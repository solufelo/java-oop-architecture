# ELI5: Java Concepts

## 1. Classes vs. Objects
Cookie Cutter vs. Cookie.

## 2. Inheritance
Family Tree. You get your dad's eyes (`name`) but your own skateboard (`gpa`).

## 3. Interfaces
A Job Badge. "Access All Areas". Doesn't matter who you are, just that you have the badge.

## 4. Polymorphism
Universal Remote. You point at TV, it turns on. You point at Stereo, it turns on. Same button (`canLogin`), different machine behavior.

## 5. Exceptions
The Fire Alarm. Stop cooking and run!

## 6. HashMaps
The Coat Check. Give a ticket (Key), get your coat (Value) instantly.

## 11. Anonymous Inner Classes
The One-Time Volunteer. "Hey you! Move this table." You don't know their name, they do one job and leave.

## 12. Covariant Return Types
The Vending Machine Upgrade. Old machine gives "Snack". New machine gives "Godiva Chocolate". It's still a snack, but better.
