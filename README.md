- **Box2D** - Physics simulation
- **CMake** - Build system
- Custom game engine with Actor-Component architecture

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **IDE:** Visual Studio / Visual Studio Code
- **Build System:** CMake
- **Graphics:** SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)
- **Physics:** Box2D
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
- **Language:** C++17/20
