# ☕ Java OOP Architecture

**Solomon Olufelo** | Software Engineer & Java Specialist  
*A comprehensive implementation of Object-Oriented design patterns, data structures, and system architecture in Java.*

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

This repository serves as a reference implementation for **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and core Java architecture. It moves beyond basic syntax to demonstrate scalable software design, inheritance hierarchies, and polymorphic behavior in real-world scenarios.

**Core Concepts Demonstrated:**
- **Polymorphism & Inheritance**: Designing flexible class hierarchies.
- **Exception Handling**: Robust error management strategies.
- **Data Structures**: Custom implementations of core collections.
- **GUI Development**: JavaFX/Swing event-driven programming.
